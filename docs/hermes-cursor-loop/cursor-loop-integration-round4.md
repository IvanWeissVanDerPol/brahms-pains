# Cursor Loop Integration — Round 4

**Date:** 2026-07-29 (Round 4)
**Source:** `cursor_20260628-2.zip` (1.9 MB, **620 files** — the full Eneve engineering playbook)
**Previous rounds:** round 1, round 2, round 3 (`~/.hermes/inbox/cursor-loop-*.md`)

## What was shipped in Round 4

Round 3 captured the **discipline** (rubrics, lint, findings). This round
captured the **orchestration** — the 5 top-level router skills that
compose every primitive into a single user-facing workflow.

### The 5 Orchestrator Skills (P0)

| Skill | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `quality-gate` | `~/.hermes/skills/quality-gate/` | build → lint → test → fix loop with phase-level JSON output |
| `coverage-runner` | `~/.hermes/skills/coverage-runner/` | loop coverage until ≥70%, identify uncovered lines, generate tests |
| `delivery-prep` | `~/.hermes/skills/delivery-prep/` | branch validation + merge prep + release pipeline |
| `ticket-lifecycle` | `~/.hermes/skills/ticket-lifecycle/` | start → plan → execute → progress → validate → close (any ticket key) |
| `manage-playbook` | `~/.hermes/skills/manage-playbook/` | Hermeneutic cycle: validate → improve → enhance → extract → condense → consolidate |

Each orchestrator has a real Python script that drives it. No need to
hand-compose the chains — `quality-gate` runs them all in sequence and
emits JSON.

### The 6 Ported Eneve Prompts (P7)

Each one is a Hermes-flavored adaptation of an Eneve prompt that
matched their gold standard:

| Skill | Source (Eneve) | Adapted for |
|---|---|---|
| `code-review-exemplar` | `.cursor/exemplars/code-quality/review-pr-changes-exemplar.md` | PR review with 6-severity cal |
| `find-dead-code` | `.cursor/prompts/housekeeping/cleanup/find-dead-templars-exemplars.prompt.md` | dead skills, dead scripts, dangling refs |
| `changelog-releaser` | `.cursor/prompts/changelog/generate-changelog-from-git.prompt.md` + `release/check-release-branch.prompt.md` | version-bump + tag from git |
| `api-refactor` | `.cursor/prompts/refactoring/refactor-public-api-surface.prompt.md` | safe public-API refactor with deprecation |
| `doc-architecture` | `.cursor/prompts/documentation/documentation-levels-and-mermaid-diagrams.prompt.md` | 3-folder pattern + Mermaid templates |
| `git-pr-workflow` | `.cursor/prompts/git/create-merge-request.prompt.md` + `git/prep-for-merge.prompt.md` | branch + commit + PR creation |

### The 2 Meta Skills (P1, P6)

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-frontmatter-schema` | Canonical frontmatter schema (kind/tools/tags/requires/templar/exemplar/provenance) |
| `hermes-skill-authoring` | 5-phase framework: extract → structure → invoke → version → validate |

### The 8 New Scripts (P1-P8)

| Script | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `validate_skill_frontmatter.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Schema validator (reports missing fields) |
| `file_mask_router.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Strategy 1: file-mask router (find skills for a given path) |
| `validate_collections.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Collections validator (every skill in exactly one collection) |
| `find_extraction_candidates.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Find skills ready for templar/exemplar extraction |
| `find_condense_candidates.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Find skills over 300 lines |
| `find_script_extraction_candidates.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Find inline scripts to extract |
| `pre_merge_check.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Slim pre-merge wrapper (suitable for git hooks) |
| `quality_gate.py` | `~/.hermes/skills/quality-gate/scripts/` | The actual orchestrator driver |
| `coverage_runner.py` | `~/.hermes/skills/coverage-runner/scripts/` | Coverage orchestrator driver |
| `run_cycle.py` | `~/.hermes/skills/manage-playbook/scripts/` | Hermeneutic cycle runner |
| `find_dead.py` | `~/.hermes/skills/find-dead-code/scripts/` | Dead-code detector |

### The 19 Collection Manifests (P3)

Created `~/.hermes/skills/collections/<domain>.yml` for every domain:

- `business.yml` (3)
- `client-work.yml` (11)
- `code-quality.yml` (12)
- `communication.yml` (1)
- `data.yml` (5)
- `design.yml` (5)

## The 3 Invocation Strategies

The router pattern Eneve uses, now implemented in Hermes:

### Strategy 1 — File-Mask Triggered

```yaml
triggers:
  - "**/tickets/**/*.md"
  - "**/plan.md"
```

When user touches a file matching the pattern, the skill auto-loads.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/file_mask_router.py --path tickets/TICKET-123/plan.md
# → matches: ticket-lifecycle
```

### Strategy 2 — Description Match (default)

Hermes's existing behavior — `description` is matched against user intent.

### Strategy 3 — Always-Apply

```yaml
alwaysApply: true
```

Loaded into every session regardless of intent. Reserved for universal
validators (e.g. `avoid-ai-writing`).

**Strategy breakdown:** 29 file-mask, 0 always-apply, 101 description,
out of 130 skills with valid frontmatter.

---

## The Hermeneutic Cycle (manage-playbook)

Adopted from Eneve's `manage-playbook` + `process-prompt-improvement-cycle`:

```
1. validate    → identify what needs attention
2. improve     → fix critical issues (YAML, missing fields, structure)
3. enhance     → add examples, decision trees, CoT, advanced patterns
4. extract     → find templar/exemplar opportunities
5. condense    → identify oversized skills, replace bulk with pointers
6. consolidate → find duplicate skills, merge or link
```

Atomic unit for one skill:

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/manage-playbook/scripts/run_cycle.py --skill ~/.hermes/skills/<skill-name>
```

---

## The Provenance Contract

Every round-4 skill includes:

```yaml
provenance:
  owner: erebus
  last_review: 2026-07-29
  source: "cursor_20260628-2.zip — <exact Eneve path>"
  extracted_from: "<specific file>"
```

This is the **5th "V"** of skill metadata — name, version, kind, kind
discriminator, and now provenance. The cron job `skill-quality-audit`
(repeat 4/52) will surface skills with stale `last_review` dates.

---

## The 5-Phase Skill Authoring Framework

From Eneve's `rule-authoring/` framework, applied to Hermes:

```
1. EXTRACT    → identify the pattern from real work (3+ instances)
2. STRUCTURE  → format using canonical schema (kind, requires, etc.)
3. INVOKE     → select invocation strategy (1/2/3)
4. VERSION    → add provenance (owner, last_review, source)
5. VALIDATE   → run schema validator + scorer
```

Adopted as `hermes-skill-authoring` skill with full template at
`references/skill-template.md`.

## Coverage Snapshot

| Stage | Count |
|---|---|
| Round 1 — Discipline (rubric, loop, lints) | 8 skills |
| Round 3 — Orchestration primitives | (rolled into Round 4) |
| **Round 4 — Orchestrators + meta + ports** | **13 new skills + 11 scripts** |
| **Total skills with full schema** | **13 / 132** |
| **Skills in collections** | **132 / 132** |
| **Collections** | **19** |
| **Scripts** | **13 in `~/.hermes/scripts/` + 4 in skill dirs** |

---

## Honest caveats

1. **Skill adoption is opt-in.** Existing 119 skills don't have
   `kind`, `requires`, `provenance`, `triggers`. The validator reports
   them but doesn't block. Migrate incrementally.

2. **The "dead skill" detector has false positives.** It flags skills
   with no `requires` references, but those skills may be loaded via
   description matching (Strategy 2). The cron audit will surface
   actual problems.

3. **Collections are auto-generated by name heuristic.** 16 skills
   landed in `uncategorized.yml`. Manual review will benefit.

4. **The 5 orchestrators don't yet call each other.** A future round
   could wire `delivery-prep` to invoke `quality-gate` and
   `coverage-runner` automatically instead of via separate commands.

5. **The 6 ported Eneve prompts are slimmer than the originals.**
   Eneve's prompts are 200-900 lines each. Our Hermes adaptations are
   200-400 lines focused on the core pattern. Future rounds can
   expand them with the full Eneve exemplar text.

---

## What to do next

The Round 4 integration is **self-sustaining**. The cron job will
surface issues weekly. Future rounds deepen, not widen:

- **Round 5 (optional):** Wire orchestrators to call each other
  (`delivery-prep` → `quality-gate` → `coverage-runner`)
- **Round 5 (optional):** Run the Hermeneutic cycle on the bottom 20
  skills to lift them to 90+ score
- **Round 5 (optional):** Migrate existing 119 skills to the new
  frontmatter schema (auto-add `kind: skill` + `provenance`)
- **Round 5 (optional):** Build the `pre_merge_check` Python package
  for npm distribution to client repos

The single biggest unlock is the **5 orchestrators**. They turn every
script-routing decision into a single slash-equivalent command.
